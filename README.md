# RealFi âœ¨
Revolutionizing Real Estate Listings with Blockchain Transparency

# Build ðŸ§©

RealFi is a decentralized application (DApp) designed to list real estate properties on the blockchain. By leveraging blockchain technology, RealFi ensures that property data remains valid, transparent, and tamper-proof. Users can access the platform to browse available properties, verify property details, and interact with property listings securely.

While RealFi remains a work in progress due to its complexity, our team is actively refining the application post-hackathon. We are dedicated to providing a seamless user experience and plan to submit RealFi as a grant proposal and solution to Cartesi. With ongoing development and collaboration, we are confident in RealFi's potential to revolutionize decentralized real estate listings.

### Challenges Faced in Meeting the Completion Deadline

#### 1. Complexity of the Project:
   - Understanding the Cartesi environment, alongside traditional dApp development on Solidity, presented a significant challenge.
   - Despite the initial difficulty, Cartesi has emerged as our preferred development tool.

#### 2. Poor Power Supply:
   - Inadequate power supply, a pervasive issue in Africa, contributed to delays in completing the project.
   - Power outages disrupted workflow and hindered progress significantly.

#### 3. Poor Network Provider:
   - The network provider faced challenges with fixing underwater fiber cables, resulting in unreliable internet connectivity.
   - Deployment of projects and accessing necessary resources for guidance were severely impacted.

### Future Plans ðŸ‘·
   - We aim to document the workflow of this project and continue its development beyond the hackathon.
   - Our goal is to present this solution leveraging Cartesi as a viable solution to the community.
# RealFi as a business solution to the Cartesi Ecosystem:

## 
RealFi merges real estate and blockchain, offering a groundbreaking platform for decentralized real estate transactions. Integrated with the Cartesi ecosystem, RealFi provides transparent, efficient, and secure solutions for real estate listings, tokenization, lending, and borrowing.

## Key Features
1. **Decentralized Records:** RealFi establishes immutable records of real estate listings on the blockchain, ensuring transparency and eliminating intermediaries.
2. **Tokenization:** RealFi enables fractional ownership of real estate assets through tokenization, allowing investors to diversify portfolios and access high-value properties.
3. **Lending & Borrowing:** RealFi facilitates collateralized loans using tokenized real estate assets as security, unlocking liquidity for property owners and providing investment opportunities for lenders.

## Business Perspective
By leveraging Cartesi's scalable infrastructure and Ethereum compatibility, RealFi ensures high-performance operations and broad market reach. Positioned at the forefront of decentralized finance (DeFi) solutions, RealFi offers innovative opportunities for investors, property owners, and developers.

## Conclusion
RealFi's integration with Cartesi revolutionizes real estate finance, offering a seamless platform for transparent, efficient, and secure transactions. With Cartesi's support, RealFi is poised to reshape the real estate industry, providing new avenues for investment and transforming the digital real estate landscape.
