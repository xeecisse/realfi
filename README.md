# RealFi
Revolutionizing Real Estate Listings with Blockchain Transparency

# Build

RealFi is a decentralized application (DApp) designed to list real estate properties on the blockchain. By leveraging blockchain technology, RealFi ensures that property data remains valid, transparent, and tamper-proof. Users can access the platform to browse available properties, verify property details, and interact with property listings securely.

While RealFi remains a work in progress due to its complexity, our team is actively refining the application post-hackathon. We are dedicated to providing a seamless user experience and plan to submit RealFi as a grant proposal and solution to Cartesi. With ongoing development and collaboration, we are confident in RealFi's potential to revolutionize decentralized real estate listings.
