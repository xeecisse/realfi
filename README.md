# RealFi
Revolutionizing Real Estate Listings with Blockchain Transparency

# Build

RealFi is a decentralized application (DApp) designed to list real estate properties on the blockchain. By leveraging blockchain technology, RealFi ensures that property data remains valid, transparent, and tamper-proof. Users can access the platform to browse available properties, verify property details, and interact with property listings securely.

# Accessing the RealFi DApp

To access the RealFi DApp, simply click on the landing page link provided. The landing page serves as the gateway to the decentralized platform, allowing users to explore property listings, interact with the smart contracts, and engage with the platform:

While RealFi remains a work in progress due to its complexity, our team is actively refining the application post-hackathon. We are dedicated to providing a seamless user experience and plan to submit RealFi as a grant proposal and solution to Cartesi. With ongoing development and collaboration, we are confident in RealFi's potential to revolutionize decentralized real estate listings.

### Challenges Faced in Meeting the Completion Deadline

#### 1. Complexity of the Project:
   - Understanding the Cartesi environment, alongside traditional dApp development on Solidity, presented a significant challenge.
   - Despite the initial difficulty, Cartesi has emerged as our preferred development tool.

#### 2. Poor Power Supply:
   - Inadequate power supply, a pervasive issue in Africa, contributed to delays in completing the project.
   - Power outages disrupted workflow and hindered progress significantly.

#### 3. Poor Network Provider:
   - The network provider faced challenges with fixing underwater fiber cables, resulting in unreliable internet connectivity.
   - Deployment of projects and accessing necessary resources for guidance were severely impacted.

### Future Plans:
   - We aim to document the workflow of this project and continue its development beyond the hackathon.
   - Our goal is to present this solution leveraging Cartesi as a viable solution to the community.
