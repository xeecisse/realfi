# RealFi
Cartesi DApp example for the hackathon

# Build

RealFi is a decentralized application (DApp) designed to list real estate properties on the blockchain. By leveraging blockchain technology, RealFi ensures that property data remains valid, transparent, and tamper-proof. Users can access the platform to browse available properties, verify property details, and interact with property listings securely.

To be able to run the simulation scripts you have to install:
- [foundry](https://book.getfoundry.sh/getting-started/installation);
- [wagyu](https://github.com/howardwu/wagyu#2-build-guide).

The simulation process involves token contracts deployment. You have to install openzeppelin package for this (the command should be performed in the root project directory, the same where this README is located):

```bash
$ npm i @openzeppelin/contracts
```
